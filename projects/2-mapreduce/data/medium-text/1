By noon, the sky burns with heat. Farmers wipe their brows; the earth cracks underfoot. Yet the fox does not stop. The fox knows the woods, the city, the hills, and the fields.

Back at the village, the baker kneads dough, the blacksmith hammers steel, and the librarian quietly organizes dusty volumes — histories of kings, tales of betrayal, and poems about stars.

The quick brown fox — yes, that same fox — leaps over fences, dodges carts, and races past startled goats. Always moving, always alert.
