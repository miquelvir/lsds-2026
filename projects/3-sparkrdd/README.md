# Using Spark RDD with Python

The goal of this lab is to use Spark RDD to analyze data.

# Grade

Requirements are divided into categories to help you prioritize.

| Weight               | Description                              | Symbol   |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------|
| 40% | Essential, needed to get something working       | (^)      |
| 30% | Nice-to-haves, not required to get something working | (^^)     |
| 30% | Difficult, complex exercises             | (^^^)    |
| +3/10 (extra) | Advanced, challenges for diving deep       | (^^^^)   |

# Submit for grading

When you have finished the project, follow these steps to submit it for grading:

1. In [submission.json](./submission.json), add a list of all exercises you have completed. If you don't add them, they won't be graded. For example:

    ```json
    [
        "1.1.1",
        "1.1.2",
        "1.1.3",
        "1.2.1",
        "1.2.6"
    ]
    ```
    
2. Make sure the basic tests are passing in the `Actions` tab in GitHub

4. Submit a link to the repository in the Aula Global task

# Work breakdown

## [3.1] SparkRDD

### [2.1.1] Summing numbers (^)

Start up a Spark cluster locally using Docker compose: `docker-compose up`.

Check the local IP for the Spark Master service in the spark-master-1 container logs. You should see a log similar to `Starting Spark master at spark://172.20.0.2:7077`.

Run the job with Spark: `docker-compose exec spark-master spark-submit --master spark://{IP_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP}:7077 /opt/bitnami/spark/app/spark_sum.py /opt/bitnami/spark/app/data/numbers1.txt`

Take a close look at the logs. What was the result of your job?

### [2.1.2] Summing even numbers (^)

The file `numbers2.txt` has many lines, each with many numbers.

Create a file `spark_sum_even.py` which computes the sum of all the even numbers.


### [2.1.3] Counting people in cities (^^)

The file `people.txt` has many lines, each with `{NAME} {LANGUAGE} {CITY}`.

Create a file `spark_count_people.py` that counts how many people live in each city.

### [2.1.4] Counting bigrams (^^)

The file `cat.txt` has many lines, each with a sentence.

Create a file `spark_count_bigrams.py` that counts how many times each bigram appears.

### [2.1.5] Reverse index (^^^)

Find the latest available Wikipedia datasets from [dumps.wikimedia](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/enterprise_html/runs/). For example, https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/enterprise_html/runs/20240901/enwiki-NS0-20240901-ENTERPRISE-HTML.json.tar.gz.

Then, download the first 10 and 1k articles in different files. The smaller datasets will be useful for testing.

```
curl -L https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/enterprise_html/runs/20240901/enwiki-NS0-20240901-ENTERPRISE-HTML.json.tar.gz | tar xz --to-stdout | head -n 10 > wikipedia10.json

curl -L https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/enterprise_html/runs/20240901/enwiki-NS0-20240901-ENTERPRISE-HTML.json.tar.gz | tar xz --to-stdout | head -n 1000 > wikipedia1000.json
```

Write a Spark RDD job that creates a reverse index for all the crawled articles. he reverse index must map every word in the abstract of every article, to the list of article (ids) that contain it. Store this as a file. The format must be: `LINE CRLF LINE CRLF LINE CRLF ...`, where each LINE is `WORD SP DOCID SP DOCID SP DOCID SP ... DOCID`. For example:
